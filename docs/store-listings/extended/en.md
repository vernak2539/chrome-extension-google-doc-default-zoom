Tired of having to change the zoom on your Google Workspace Applications when they first load because the text is too small? Well, this should help.

This extension will allow you to set a "default zoom" for the following Google Workspace Applications:

- Google Docs
- Google Sheets

Once you set your desired zoom level, the level of zoom will be changed whenever you load a Google Workspace Applications.

If you'd like to help me translate this for languages other than English, please reach out!!

This version includes functionality to allow for custom zoom levels, which requires elevated browser permissions to work. Because of this change, you may see a message that says "'Default zoom for Google Workspace (Extended)' started debugging this browser".

Please don't worry. This is a normal message confirming the extension is working correctly. You can safely ignore it.

Don't worry! If you do not want to accept the elevated permissions, you can use my other extension, which allows for the use of pre-defined zoom values. It is available here (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-workspace-zoom-def/nflkcdlimipkgbacnfnhfecjgmojhklo).
