Tired of having to change the zoom on your Google Workspace Applications when they first load because the text is too small? Well, this should help.

This extension will allow you to set a "default zoom" for the following Google Workspace Applications:

- Google Docs
- Google Sheets

Once you set your desired zoom level, the level of zoom will be changed whenever you load a Google Workspace Applications.

If you'd like to help me translate this for languages other than English, please reach out!!

If you'd like to use your own custom zoom values, please checkout my other extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-workspace-zoom-def/mdgikencgfhineaememjagpkiclbdkka).
